**Code Structure:**

*Documentation*: Documentations related to this project, including coding style and development plans.

*Public_Library*: Public API of Physika.

- *include*: Header files generated by Physika after compilation. Any project built on Physika simply needs to include files in this directory.
	
- *lib*: Binary files generated by Physika after compilation.
	
*Physika_Src*: Source code of Physika, including 3rd party libraries that Physika uses. After compilation, header files and binary libraries would be copied to the 2 directories in *Public_Library* directory.

*Projects*: Projects built on Physika. Generally they simply need to include necessary header files and link corresponding binaries of Physika.
